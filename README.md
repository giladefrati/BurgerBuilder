## Reflection
A side project that was developed through the process of learning the Front-end development world.

The application is a responsive web app, mainly focus on practicing on building functional components and implementing a design.
It was built with React.js, JS ES6, HTML5 and CSS3 newest techniques.

The experience of learning something by me own was challenging, but worth it, through the fact I got to know the front-end using the newest technologies, with such a huge community support.

The project was developed through the guidance of Udemy course, and might be expanded in the future.
