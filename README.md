## Reflection
A side project that was developed through the process of learning the front-end development world.

The application is a responsive web app, mainly focus on practicing on building functional components and with a fine responsive design.
It was built with React.js, JS ES6, HTML5 and CSS3 newest techniques.

The experience of self-study was challenging, but worth it, because I got a glimpse of the world of Web development, and got to know such a huge and supportive community.

The project was developed through the guidance of Udemy course, and might be expanded in the future.
